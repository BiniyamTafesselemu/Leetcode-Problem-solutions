## About

This repository includes my personal solutions to LeetCode problems. The goal is to help others learn and improve their problem-solving skills in coding using python.

## Languages Used

- Python


## How to Use

1. **View the Repository**:
   - Simply visit the repository on GitHub to browse through the solutions organized by difficulty.


2. **Navigate the Directory Structure**:
   - The repository is organized into three main folders based on difficulty: `Easy`, `Medium`, and `Hard`. 
   - Each difficulty folder is further divided by problem type (e.g., `Array`, `String`, `Math`).
   - Here’s the structure you’ll follow:


   LeetCode-Solutions/
│
├── Easy/
│   ├── Array/
│   │   ├── Problem1.py
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── String/
│   │   ├── Problem2.py
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
│
├── Medium/
│   ├── Array/
│   │   ├── Problem1.py
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── String/
│   │   ├── Problem2.py
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
│
└── Hard/
├── Math/
│   ├── Problem1.py
│   └── ...
├── Array/
│   ├── Problem2.py
│   └── ...
└── ...
3. **Open Solution Files**:
   - Click on any solution file (e.g., `Problem1.py`) to view the code directly in your browser.

4. **Copy the Code**:
   - You can copy the code from the browser if you wish to run it locally or in an online compiler.


Feel free to explore the solutions and improve your coding skills!
